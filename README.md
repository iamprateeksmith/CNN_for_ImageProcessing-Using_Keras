Image classification is the process of segmenting images into different categories based on their features. A feature could be the edges in an image, the pixel intensity, the change in pixel values, and many more

#### What is Image Classification?
* Image classification is the process of segmenting images into different categories based on their features. A feature could be the edges in an image, the pixel intensity, the change in pixel values, and many more.A same individual person however varies when compared across features like the color of the image, position of the face, the background color, color of the shirt, and many more. 
* The biggest challenge when working with images is the uncertainty of these features. To the human eye, it looks all the same, however, when converted to data you may not find a specific pattern across these images easily.

* An image consists of the smallest indivisible segments called pixels and every pixel has a strength often known as the pixel intensity. Whenever we study a digital image, it usually comes with three color channels, i.e. the Red-Green-Blue channels, popularly known as the “RGB” values. Why RGB? Because it has been seen that a combination of these three can produce all possible color pallets. Whenever we work with a color image, the image is made up of multiple pixels with every pixel consisting of three different values for the RGB channels
